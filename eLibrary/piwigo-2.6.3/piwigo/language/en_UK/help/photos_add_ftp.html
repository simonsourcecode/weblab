  <legend>Quick Start</legend>

<ol>
  <li>Create a directory on your computer.</li>  

  <li>Copy some photos inside this directory, resize them for web display. <em>Warning</em>: the name of directories and files must contain only letters, figures, "-", "_" or ".". No blank space, nor accentuated characters.</li>

  <li>With a FTP client, copy your directory in the "galleries" directory of your Piwigo installation.</li>

  <li>Logon your gallery and go to <span class="pwgScreen">Administration</span> and click on the big Synchronization button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully created the first album of your photo gallery.</p>

  <legend>Directories and files organization</legend>

<ul>

  <li>

    <p>Album directories are in the Piwigo directory
    "galleries". Here follows the directory tree of a very small gallery (but
    using many features):</p>

    <pre>

|   |-- celebration
|   |   |-- arrival
|   |   |   |-- paul-alone.jpg

    |-- hotel.png
    |-- video-from-plane.avi
    +-- pwg_representative
        +-- video-from-plane.jpg
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>Except for "pwg_representative" (see explanations below), each directory under "galleries" produces a album. There is no limit on deepness.</li>

  <li>Basically, an element is represented by a file. A file can be a
  Piwigo element if its extension is among <code>file_ext</code>
  configuration parameter possibilities (see <span
  class="filename">include/config_default.inc.php</span> file). A file can
  be a picture if its extension is among <code>picture_ext</code>
  configuration parameter possibilities.</li>

  <li>No photo elements (video, sounds, file texts, whatever you want...) are represented by default by an icon corresponding to the filename
  extension. Optionally, you can associate a thumbnail and a representative
  file (see video.avi in the example above).</li>

  <li><em>Warning</em>: the name of directories and files must contain only letters, figures, "-", "_" or ".". No blank space, nor accentuated characters.</li>

  <li>Once photos are correctly placed in the
  directories, go to: <span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Tools &raquo;
  Synchronize</span></li>

</ul>
