<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>To optimize page generation time, Piwigo uses cached
information. For example, instead of counting the number of pictures
contained in each category at each page reload, this information is stored
in the database. In theory, this information should always be correct, but
sometimes an error can occur and cached information becomes wrong.</p>

<p>Some informations become useless with time. Deleting this useless
information from database make you save disk space.</p>
